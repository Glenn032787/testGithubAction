title: "Figure 3C-E generation (ASE)"
output: github_document
---

This R markdown is to generate Figure 3C-E relating to allele specific expression (ASE) analysis of Nanopore Long POG cohort. 


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggbeeswarm)

```

This chunk is used to import necessary libraries and import ASE summary results. The summary results are generated using the IMPALA pipeline. 

# Figure 3C
This figure shows the classification of genes in the IMPALA pipeline. Genes are sepperated based on low expression (<1 TPM), fully phased (contained phased SNP), ASE (major expressing allele frequecny â‰¥ 0.65) and biallelic expression (BAE) gene (major expressing allele frequecny < 0.65).

This chunk obtains the number of expressed, phased, ASE and BAE gene in each sample. This is the preprocessing for figure 3C
```{r}
a <- 1:5
fig <- tibble(a, a * 2)
fig
```
